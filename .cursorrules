### Key Principles

- **Code Style**:
    - Write concise, clear code with descriptive variable and function names.
    - Prefer functional programming and modularization, avoiding classes unless necessary.
    - Use lowercase with underscores for file and directory names (e.g., `views/main_view.py`).
    - Follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle and optimize for reusability.
- **Tkinter/CustomTkinter Guidelines**:
    - Use **Tkinter** for basic functionality and **CustomTkinter** for modern, styled GUIs.
    - Separate interface (view), event handling (controller), and state (model) into distinct modules.
    - Leverage **event-driven programming** for better UI responsiveness.
- **GUI Design**:
    - Design simple and user-friendly interfaces with intuitive navigation.
    - Ensure consistency in layout and styles across all screens and operating systems.
    - Support adaptive layouts for different screen resolutions.
- **Cross-Platform Packaging**:
    - Use **PyInstaller** to package applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    - Test the application across multiple operating systems before release.

├── app.py                # Application entry point
├── views/                # GUI components (Tkinter/CustomTkinter views)
│   ├── main_view.py
│   └── settings_view.py
├── controllers/          # Event handling and application logic
│   ├── main_controller.py
│   └── settings_controller.py
├── models/               # Application state and data models
│   └── config_model.py
├── assets/               # Resources like images, icons
│   └── logo.png
├── utils/                # Utility functions
